dcsj-grid-ourgrid
=================

A set of Java libraries aimed at providing functionalities for the grid computing paradigm through the OurGrid middleware.

[OurGrid](http://www.ourgrid.org "OurGrid") is an open source grid middleware based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, developed by OurGrid the Federal University of Campina Grande.
This middleware enables the creation of P2P computational grids, and since, its first release in December 2004, it has been used by hundreds of users to speed up the execution of Bag-of-Tasks applications.
These include parameter sweep simulations, image rendering, optimization algorithms, and many others.

The dcsj-grid-ourgrid project implements the functionalities defined by the dcsj-grid-core project for the OurGrid version 3 middleware.
